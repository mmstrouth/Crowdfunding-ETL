# Crowdfunding-ETL

After receiving a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects, Independent Funding requested an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

This analysis used: Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, the following occurred: 
- Extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that was exported as a CSV file. 
- Used the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. 
- Uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. 
- Performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
